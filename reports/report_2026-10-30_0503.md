### 💬 What Happened
A single wallet sent 12 identical, zero‑value ETH transfers to a bridge contract on Across SpokePool V2. It’s like dropping the same empty envelope into a slot over and over again to hide how much you’re actually sending.

### 🔥 The Roast
Nice job, 0‑ETH smurfing—because obviously the only thing you can do with zero is to make it look like you’re not doing anything. 12 identical zero‑value transfers? That’s the kind of pattern that makes the AML engine go ‘Whoa, someone’s playing the copy‑paste game with a wallet that’s been around longer than your grandma’s cat.’ And the fact that it landed on Across SpokePool V2 shows you’re not just playing with your own money—you're hopping across chains like a bad karaoke contestant. The engine gave you a structuring score of 70 (identical deposits), a peel_chain_linear score of 60 (layering in a straight line), and a bridge_hop score of 65 (cross‑chain bridge use), which together form a perfect storm of suspicious activity. Basically, you’re trying to layer money but you forgot to put any money in the first place.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL — the transaction exhibits multiple high‑risk AML indicators (structuring, peel chain, and bridge hop) with a composite score of 195, exceeding the critical threshold.**

Flag the transaction for manual review by the compliance team. Initiate a deeper source‑of‑funds investigation and monitor the wallet for additional suspicious activity.

| **Activity** | **7** txs totaling **0.0000 ETH** ($0) |
| **Blocks** | 26303122-26303250 |

### 💬 What Happened
The sender sent a tiny amount of ETH, exactly 0.0000, seven times in a row to a wallet that moves money between different blockchains. Each transfer was identical, so it looks like someone is trying to split up a single move into many small ones to make it harder to trace. Imagine someone dropping a single coin into a vending machine slot seven times to confuse the cashier.

### 🔥 The Roast
Looks like someone decided to practice the art of the ‘splitting the bill’ trick on crypto, sending zero ETH seven times like a broken record. Structuring (splitting a big move into tiny ones) is score 70, peel_chain_linear (peeling layers one after another) is 60, and bridge_hop (jumping between chains like a hopping frog) is 65 – the wallet’s composite score is a whopping 195, so it’s basically the crypto equivalent of a red flag waving at a traffic cop. The sender’s account is older than a small country (1074 days) and has over 200k transactions, but it’s still moving zero ETH, so maybe it’s a prank, a bot, or just a very picky collector of empty pockets. Either way, this is more suspicious than a cat in a room full of laser pointers.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL (rule score 195)**

| **Blocks** | 26303101-26303295 |

### 💬 What Happened
The sender sent 13 almost‑tiny Ethereum payments (each about zero ETH) to a settlement contract that moves funds between chains. Think of it like dropping 13 empty envelopes into a mail slot that hides who’s actually sending the money. The sender’s wallet is only 17 days old but has been very active, making a lot of moves in a short time.

### 🔥 The Roast
Looks like this wallet is trying to play hide‑and‑seek with the blockchain. 13 identical zero‑eth deposits? That’s textbook smurfing (structuring) – like a magician splitting a single coin into a dozen invisible coins. The pattern’s called peel_chain_linear (layering) – it’s the blockchain equivalent of a chain of paper dolls. And the bridge_hop? That’s a cross‑chain hop, as if the wallet said, "Let’s go from Ethereum to something else and hide the trail."  If you’re looking for a thrill, this wallet is giving you the full roller‑coaster of suspicious activity.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL (rule score 195)**

Flag the sender wallet for manual AML review, conduct a detailed transaction graph analysis, and monitor for further activity or attempts to move funds to off‑chain mixers.

**SAR Narrative** *(for compliance teams)*:
The sender wallet performed 13 consecutive transactions of 0.0000 ETH to the CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement address, exhibiting a structuring pattern per Rule [structuring] (score 70). The identical, sequential nature of these transfers also triggers Rule [peel_chain_linear] (score 60) indicating layering. Additionally, Rule [bridge_hop] (score 65) flags the cross‑chain settlement as a bridge hop, heightening risk. The composite score of 195 warrants elevated scrutiny under AML monitoring procedures.

| **Blocks** | 26303100-26303294 |

### 💬 What Happened
A single wallet sent 41 almost‑zero ETH transfers—each worth practically nothing—to a settlement contract on the CoW Protocol. The wallet has been active for about two and a half months, has made nearly 50,000 transactions, and still holds a small balance of roughly 4.3 ETH. These tiny, identical packets look like someone is trying to hide the trail of their moves.

### 🔥 The Roast
This wallet is basically the grandmaster of the ‘I put a penny in the ATM and hope the bank doesn’t notice’ game. 41 identical 0.0000 ETH transfers? That’s like sending 41 copies of a blank check to a settlement contract—good luck catching that! The engine gave it a composite score of 195, high enough to make a regulator blush. It’s a full‑on multi‑layering party: structuring (splitting money into tiny bits) scored 70, peel_chain_linear (a linear chain of these tiny deposits) scored 60, and a bridge hop (cross‑chain movement) scored 65. In short, this is the crypto equivalent of dropping crumbs on a kitchen floor and hoping the cat doesn’t see.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL — The combination of structuring, peel chain, and bridge hop patterns indicates a high probability of layering to obscure the source of funds.**

Flag the sender wallet for further investigation, request source‑of‑funds documentation, and monitor subsequent activity for any large or anomalous transfers.

### 💬 What Happened
A user sent four tiny, identical ETH deposits—each worth zero—into a decentralized exchange settlement contract. Think of it like dropping four identical empty boxes into a slot that hides who put them in. The total value is $0, so nothing actually moved, but the pattern looks fishy.

### 🔥 The Roast
Looks like someone tried to hide their money by sending 0 ETH four times—like trying to pay a bill with invisible coins. The structuring rule (meaning the engine thinks the deposits are too uniform to be legitimate) scored a 70, so the system thinks you’re smurfing the zero value like a kid trying to sneak candy into a school. The peel_chain_linear rule (flagging a peel chain—four sequential deposits of the same amount) hit 60, and the bridge_hop rule (detecting a cross‑chain bridge to the CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement) added another 65 to the score. Bottom line: your transaction pattern screams “I’m trying to layer this money, but I’m too lazy to actually move any.”

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL (rule score 195)**

Recommend a detailed manual review of the sender’s transaction history, confirm the source of funds, and assess whether the deposits are part of a larger layering scheme. If further evidence of suspicious activity emerges, consider filing a SAR.

### 💬 What Happened
The user sent the same tiny amount of ETH (0.0000) four times in a row to a smart contract that helps move money between blockchains. It's like dropping four identical empty envelopes into a slot that hides who sent them. The total value is zero, so no cash changed hands, but the pattern looks suspicious.

### 🔥 The Roast
Four zero‑ETH deposits? That's like someone trying to hide a pizza delivery order by sending four empty boxes. The structuring rule gave it a 70, because 0.0000 ETH is the cryptocurrency equivalent of a prank call. The peel_chain_linear hit 60—looks like a chain reaction of copy‑paste deposits. And bridge_hop scored 65—because the sender is moving their 'nothing' across a bridge like a tourist hopping between flights for free.

A wallet sent three tiny, identical amounts of ETH—each worth practically nothing—to a settlement contract on the CoW Protocol. Think of it like dropping three identical, invisible coins into a slot that hides where they came from, but the slot is actually a bridge that moves money between blockchains.

### 🔥 The Roast
Looks like someone tried to smuggle a bunch of zeros through a blockchain tunnel. 0.0000 ETH is about as useful as a paperclip in a crypto vault. The pattern screams 'structuring'—they’re layering the same zero amount like a bad magician’s trick. And that CoW Protocol? It's the cross-chain bridge where you can hide a few coins and think you're doing a legit swap. Honestly, it's like playing Monopoly with a bag of Monopoly money.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps

The wallet is only 48 days old but has already made over six thousand transactions, and the balance still sits at about 0.06 ETH. No tokens were moved, only tiny ETH packets that all look the same.

### 🔥 The Roast
Looks like someone tried to practice the art of smurfing, but forgot they’re not actually smurfing anything—just four zero‑ETH packets. The AML engine gave it a 70 for structuring (that’s the fancy way of saying “smurfing” or “spreading out money in tiny amounts”), a 60 for peel_chain_linear (the “layering” pattern where you keep adding the same thing in a row), and a 65 for bridge_hop (because they hopped over to CoW Protocol, like a bridge to a different island). Even though the amounts are zero, the pattern screams “I’m hiding something,” and the engine is raising the red flag like a bored teacher pointing at a student who keeps doing the same trick.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL (rule score 195)**

Flag the wallet for manual review, request source‑of‑funds information, and monitor for any additional suspicious activity.

### 💬 What Happened
A single wallet sent eight tiny, identical ETH deposits—each worth 0.0000 ETH—to a settlement contract on the CoW Protocol. It’s like a cashier dropping eight empty envelopes into a slot, one after the other, to hide the fact that nothing actually moved. The sender’s account has been very active for about 1.5 years and still holds a small balance, so it looks like a normal user, but the way the deposits were split up raises eyebrows.

### 🔥 The Roast
So, the wallet decided to do the eight‑pack trick, scoring a solid 70 on structuring (meaning it tried to hide a tiny cash flow by smurfing it into eight zero‑value packets). Then it pulled a peel chain, 60 points on peel_chain_linear, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat but with 8 identical rabbits. Finally, it hopped across a bridge with a 65 on bridge_hop, meaning it used a cross‑chain bridge to a settlement contract—essentially moving through a tunnel that keeps the original address a mystery. All this makes the engine shout "danger!" even though the total value is $0, because the pattern itself is suspicious.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**CRITICAL — the combination of structuring, peel chain layering, and cross‑chain bridge activity constitutes a high‑risk pattern that merits immediate manual review.**

Flag the wallet for enhanced due diligence and monitor subsequent activity for additional suspicious patterns. If further structuring or layering occurs, consider escalating to a full compliance investigation and reporting to relevant authorities.

### 💬 What Happened
A single wallet sent about $25,000 worth of USDC to a DeFi settlement contract in three separate chunks. It’s like dropping a big pizza order into a blind‑folded courier service that splits it into slices before sending it to the restaurant, so you can’t tell who ordered it.

### 🔥 The Roast
HIGH (rule score 110) The total $25k is a lot of dough for a tiny wallet with zero ETH balance, so it’s basically the blockchain equivalent of a secret sauce. If you’re looking for a clean transaction, this is more like a shady recipe – it’s all in plain USDC, but the way it’s split is suspicious. The engine’s giving it a 110, which is like a red flag on a “Do Not Use” sticker. HIGH (rule score 110)

### 💬 What Happened
The sender’s wallet sent a bundle of stablecoins (like $1 million in different flavored paper money) to a smart‑contract address that acts as a settlement hub for a trading protocol. Think of it as someone stuffing a large box of mixed candies into a slot machine that hides the original box’s label, making it hard to tell where the candies came from.

### 🔥 The Roast
So this guy sent $1,017,319 worth of stablecoins to CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement (a fancy way of saying a crypto trading settlement bot). He’s basically doing a stablecoin conga line, moving 19 separate payments that add up to more than a million dollars. HIGH (rule score 110) If you thought a single big transfer was suspicious, just wait until you see a dozen tiny ones all aimed at the same smart‑contract address – it’s like a magician pulling coins out of a hat, but the hat’s actually a black hole.

A single wallet sent almost $270,000 in stablecoins, split into 18 separate transfers, to a decentralized settlement contract. It’s like dropping a large pile of money into a slot that hides who sent it, then letting the contract shuffle the coins around before they’re distributed to unknown parties.

### 💬 What Happened
A single wallet sent almost exactly the same amount of stablecoins four times to a special address that settles trades on the CoW Protocol. It's like dropping four identical packages into a black‑box chute that hides who sent them, making it hard to trace the original source.

### 🔥 The Roast
HIGH (rule score 110) Four identical USDT/USDC transfers to a GPv2Settlement address are basically the crypto version of a magician’s trick—same coins, same amounts, and no one knows where the money came from.

| **Blocks** | 26303183-26303282 |

### 💬 What Happened
A single wallet sent seven separate stablecoin payments to the CoW Protocol settlement contract, totalling about $1.44 million. Think of it like a person dropping a bag of cash into a vending machine that then splits it into smaller packets for different vendors, but the machine hides who actually paid. The pattern looks like someone is trying to obscure the origin of the money by moving it through a protocol that aggregates and settles trades.

### 🔥 The Roast
So we’ve got a wallet that’s basically a one‑stop shop for mixing your USDC and USDT. It’s like that one friend who drops a bunch of cash into a communal pot and then pretends to be a charity. The AML engine gave it a 110, which is basically the equivalent of a red flag on a credit card. Scored 110 on the stablecoin_mixing rule (meaning the wallet is moving a large amount of stablecoins through a protocol that can obscure origins), and with a total of $1.44M, that’s not a small change. If this was a real person, they'd need a very fancy alibi.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**HIGH — the transaction pattern meets the stablecoin_mixing rule with a composite score of 110, indicating a high likelihood of layering activity.**

Flag the sender address for manual review, request source of funds documentation, and monitor the address for further high‑value stablecoin activity.

- **stablecoin_mixing** (+110) — 5 stablecoin transfer(s) to CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement (intent settlement): $511,254 total (USDC, USDT) from 1 unique sender(s)

**SAR Narrative** *(for compliance teams)*:
The sender wallet (0x80b4a27276d0c9cce34bf984877c5c9ed5982a9f) executed 7 token transfers to the CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement contract (0x9008d19f58aabd9ed0d60971565aa8510560ab41) between blocks 26303183 and 26303282, totaling $1,443,245 in stablecoins. Five of those transfers (USDC 507, USDT 3,085, FUN 442,642, USDT 236,362, USDT 270,505) meet the criteria for the stablecoin_mixing rule, scoring 110. The pattern suggests potential layering and obfuscation of funds. HIGH (rule score 110)

| **Sender** | `0x064a804e338083693b8efb4a7f440de608a72a3a` |
| **Target** | CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement (intent settlement) (`0x9008d19f58aabd9ed0...`) |
| **Activity** | **1** token transfer totaling **$300,548** (300,548 USDT) |
| **Blocks** | 26303280-26303280 |

### 💬 What Happened
A wallet that nobody knows much about sent a huge pile of USDT—about $300,000—to a DeFi settlement address that acts like a drop‑box for many people, so nobody can see where the money originally came from.

### 🔥 The Roast
So the engine gave this a 110 on stablecoin_mixing (meaning it thinks the wallet is part of a big stablecoin shuffle). Basically it’s like dropping a $300k package into a blind box that hides the sender—nice! The address 0x9008d19f58aabd9ed0d60971565aa8510560ab41 is just a fancy name for the CoW Protocol GPv2Settlement, the place where people settle trades. It’s a bit like a bank that accepts deposits but never tells you who put them in. If you’re a compliance officer, you might want to pull up the audit trail and see who’s been dropping stuff in there. Good luck!

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**HIGH — the transaction meets the stablecoin_mixing rule with a large amount, indicating a high‑risk mixing activity.**

Flag the transaction for manual review, request source‑of‑funds documentation from the sender, and monitor the wallet’s subsequent activity for further suspicious patterns.

**SAR Narrative** *(for compliance teams)*:
The transaction from 0x064a804e338083693b8efb4a7f440de608a72a3a to 0x9008d19f58aabd9ed0d60971565aa8510560ab41 involved a single transfer of 300,548 USDT, matching the stablecoin_mixing rule (Rule ID: stablecoin_mixing). The sender’s wallet profile is incomplete, with unknown age, transaction count, and days since last activity, and the wallet holds no ETH balance. This pattern aligns with high‑risk mixing activity and warrants further investigation per AML policy. Risk assessment: The transaction triggers a high‑risk rule due to the large stablecoin amount and mixing pattern, warranting additional scrutiny.

| **Blocks** | 26303280-26303280 |

### 💬 What Happened
A user sent $300,000 worth of a digital dollar (USDC) to a service that helps people disguise where their money came from. Think of it like dropping a $300k envelope into a machine that scrambles who put it in and then gives you a new receipt with a different address. The whole thing happened in a single block, so it was a quick shuffle.

### 🔥 The Roast
Scored a whopping 110 on stablecoin_mixing (meaning this transaction is a textbook case of using a stablecoin to hide money). The sender’s wallet is basically a ghost: no ETH, no activity record—like a person who left all their cash in a bank that only accepts Bitcoin but never actually uses it. HIGH (rule score 110) HIGH (rule score 110) In short, this is the crypto equivalent of a shady tip jar that ends up in a shell company.

### 🎯 Verdict & Next Steps
**HIGH (rule score 110)**

Flag the transaction for manual review, verify the source of the USDC, and monitor the receiver address for further suspicious activity. HIGH (rule score 110)

**SAR Narrative** *(for compliance teams)*:
HIGH (rule score 110) The AML engine applied the stablecoin_mixing rule and assigned a composite score of 110, indicating high suspicion. The lack of wallet activity history and the use of a large stablecoin amount raise concerns for potential layering. This activity warrants further investigation under internal AML policy.
